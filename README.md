# AI-Flappy-Bird-Game
An AI agent that learns to play Flappy Bird using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. This project uses [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for game rendering and [NEAT-Python](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for training the neural networks.
