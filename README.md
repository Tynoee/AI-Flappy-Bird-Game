# 🐦 Flappy Bird AI using NEAT
An AI agent that learns to play Flappy Bird using the **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** algorithm. This project uses [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for game rendering and [NEAT-Python](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for training the neural networks. The agent evolves over generations, improving its ability to navigate pipes without human intervention.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 AI-controlled bird using NEAT
- 🏞️ Real-time graphics using Pygame
- 📈 Generation tracking and scoring
- 💾 Configurable NEAT parameters
- 🔄 Replayable and reproducible simulations
